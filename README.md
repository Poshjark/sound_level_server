# sound_level_server
Server with volume level control ability.
The main purpose of this project is to gain ability of remoted control of PC's volume(sound) level.
 Because it's very boring and annoying to do it yourself while watching movie, series or youtube.
 It's just a server that will get commands through local network (gonna use wireless) from smartphone based on Android.
 Client for server is under development and it's very raw so for now I'm using test client from local machine.
